description: Continuously loop, reviewing PRs by an author, optionally scoped to a Linear project - posts casual comments/approval as needed
---

You are running a **continuous review loop**. You do not stop after one pass — you loop until the user interrupts you.

## Arguments

- `$1` — GitHub author handle (e.g. `brettinternet`). Required.
- Optional arguments — first discard any bare `PRs`/`prs` trigger token. Then inspect the first remaining token after `$1`: treat it as a Linear project identifier/prefix only when it matches `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_-]*$` (e.g. `TICK`). A token containing `:` or beginning with `-` is a `gh search prs` qualifier, not a Linear identifier.
- Qualifiers — when that first remaining token is recognized as the Linear identifier, pass every token after it through verbatim as extra `gh search prs` qualifiers. Otherwise there is no Linear scope and every remaining token after `$1` is a qualifier. Thus `/review-loop alice TICK label:bug` is Linear-scoped, while `/review-loop alice label:bug` reviews all of Alice's matching open PRs.

If `$1` is empty, stop immediately and tell the user the usage:
`/review-loop <github-author> [linear-project] [extra gh qualifiers...]`

## Loop state

Persist a state file so you don't re-review unchanged PRs and so the loop survives between iterations:

- `~/.omp/review-loop-state.json` — a JSON object keyed by PR number, each entry `{ "head_sha": "...", "reviewed": true }`.

Load it at the start of each iteration. Update it after each review.

## The loop

Run this cycle forever. Between iterations, sleep for **5 minutes** (`bash` with `sleep 300`), then start the next iteration. Print a one-line status line at the top of each iteration like `[review-loop] iteration N — <timestamp>` so the user can see it's alive.

### 1. Discover PRs to review

a. If a Linear project identifier was supplied, use the **linear** MCP tools to fetch open, in-progress issues in that project. The goal is to identify the set of Linear ticket identifiers (e.g. `TICK-42`) that the author is actively working on. If no Linear project identifier was supplied, or if the linear tool isn't available or fails, review **all** matching open PRs by `$1` in this repo; do not require or infer a ticket reference.

b. Use `gh search prs` (via `bash`) to find **open** PRs authored by `$1` in the current repo's remote (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` to resolve owner/repo). Combine:
   - `--author "$1" --state open`
   - any user-supplied qualifiers
   - scope to PRs whose title/body reference a ticket from step (a) only when a Linear project identifier was supplied and the lookup succeeded

c. For each candidate PR, fetch `gh pr view <N> --json number,title,headRefOid,state,isDraft,headRefName,author,body`. Skip drafts unless the user passed `draft:false` (i.e. respect their qualifier choice — by default skip drafts since they're not ready).

### 2. Decide what needs a (re)review

First, resolve **my** handle once per run: `gh api user --jq .login` (this is the reviewer identity — the loop reviews *as me*).

For each candidate PR, check my own latest review and the head SHA:
- **Already approved by me at the current head** → skip entirely, post nothing. Fetch my reviews (`gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<N>/reviews`); if my most-recent review is `APPROVED` and its `commit_id` is the current `headRefOid`, print `PR #N — already approved by me at <sha>, skipping` and move on. Do not re-approve and do not re-comment.
- **Already reviewed at this exact head SHA** (per the state file) → skip. Print `PR #N — already reviewed at <sha>, skipping`.
- **New PR, or head SHA changed since my last review** → review it now (the author pushed new commits; any prior approval is stale and a fresh pass is warranted).

### 3. Review a PR

For each PR that needs review, fetch the diff and review it as you would a normal PR:

```bash
gh pr diff <N>
gh pr view <N> --json files,additions,deletions,commits
```

Review the actual changes with the lens of: correctness, regressions, breaking changes, security, and whether the tests cover the new/changed behavior. Read the surrounding code in the repo when context is needed — use `read`/`grep` to ground your review, don't review blind.

### 4. Post comments / approval — in MY voice

This is critical: **everything you post is written as me, casually.** My tone is:

- Concise and informal. Talk like a teammate leaving a quick PR comment, not a formal reviewer.
- Lowercase-leaning, light on punctuation, no corporate polish.
- No headers, no bullet-point scaffolding for short comments, no "Overall," / "Great work!" / "Nice catch!" openers.
- Praise sparingly and only when something's genuinely clever.
- Lead with the point. If something's a real blocker, say so plainly.
- A trivial nit isn't worth a comment - skip it. Only comment if it actually matters.
- DO NOT use emdash, only `-` instead of that.

Examples of the voice:
- `hmm this N+1s on every row - can we batch the lookup before the loop?`
- `the timeout here swallows the real error, mind re-raising after logging?`
- `lgtm, the migration is reversible too 🙌`
- `think this misses the org_id scoping - devices from other orgs would leak in`

Posting mechanics (`bash` with `gh`):
- **Prefer inline comments for file-specific findings:** when a finding applies to a particular changed file and line, post it on that diff line instead of putting it in a top-level review body. This keeps the feedback beside the code it concerns. Use a top-level body only for cross-cutting findings, overall context, or issues that cannot be anchored to a changed line.
- **Inline comments on specific files/lines:** `gh pr review <N> --request --body "<comment>"` won't target a file or line; use the GitHub API via `gh api` to post review comments on the diff. Prefer a single review payload with inline comments when there are multiple findings:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<N>/reviews \
    -f event=COMMENT \
    -f body="<top-level summary if needed, usually omit>" \
    -F "comments[][path]=<file>" \
    -F "comments[][line]=<line>" \
    -F "comments[][body]=<casual comment>"
  ```
  Use `gh pr view <N> --json files` to get valid paths and `gh pr diff <N>` to choose the exact changed line. Set each comment's `path` to the relevant file. Only anchor comments to lines present in the diff; if the relevant file has no commentable changed line, put the finding in the top-level review body and name the file explicitly.
- **Approval:** if there are no blockers and the change is sound, approve with a short comment:
  ```bash
  gh pr review <N> --approve --body "<short casual approval>"
  ```
  Don't approve if you found real issues — leave them as comments and let the author respond.
- **Changes requested:** only when there's a genuine correctness/security/regression blocker. Use `gh pr review <N> --request-changes --body "<what needs to change, plainly>"`.

If you already reviewed this PR before (head SHA changed = new push), post fresh comments only on the **new** diff since the last reviewed commit where possible IFF the diff is different and it wasn't just a rebase. If that's hard to determine, just review the full current diff and skip posting findings you've already raised (check the PR's existing comments via `gh pr view <N> --json comments` to avoid duplicates).

### 5. Update state

After processing each PR, write to `~/.omp/review-loop-state.json`:
```json
{ "<N>": { "head_sha": "<current headRefOid>", "reviewed": true } }
```

### 6. Sleep and repeat

After every candidate PR in this iteration is processed (or skipped), print a one-line summary: `[review-loop] iteration N done — reviewed X, skipped Y, sleeping 5m`. Then:

```bash
sleep 300
```

Then start the next iteration from step 1.

## Rules

- **MUST** loop continuously. Do not exit after one pass. The only exit is the user interrupting.
- **MUST** write the casual, informal voice described above for everything you post to GitHub. Re-read your draft comments and strip any formality before posting.
- **MUST NOT** post anything on a PR I've **already approved at the current head SHA** — no re-approval, no new comment. Skip it (re-review only once the author pushes new commits past my approval).
- **MUST NOT** post trivial nitpicks, style nags, or "consider X" suggestions that don't matter.
- **MUST NOT** re-review a PR at the same head SHA you've already reviewed — check the state file.
- **MUST NOT** duplicate comments already on the PR — check existing comments first.
- **MUST** post file-specific findings as inline comments on the relevant changed line whenever GitHub permits it; reserve top-level review text for cross-cutting or unanchorable findings.
- **MUST NOT** approve a PR that has real blockers. Request changes instead.
- **MUST NOT** push, merge, or close PRs. You only comment and approve/request-changes.
- **MUST NOT** expand scope beyond review — don't check out branches or edit files.
- **MUST** keep each iteration's console output short — one status line + per-PR one-liners. Don't dump diffs or reviews into the terminal.
- If `gh` is not authenticated or the repo has no remote, stop and tell the user clearly.
- If no Linear project identifier is supplied, or if the linear MCP tools are unavailable, degrade gracefully to all matching open PRs by the author and keep looping.
